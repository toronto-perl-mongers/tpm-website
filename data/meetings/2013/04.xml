        Henry gives us a very informative "regurgitation" of a keynote talk that Rob Pike presented at
SPLASH 2012.

        <h4>Meeting Notes:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Go is "Object-Based", not "Object-Oriented"</li>
		<li>Functions are first-class citizens</li>
		<li>Instead of classes and objects, you have packages and functions (and function wrappers)</li>
		<li>Go is intended as a systems language, intended to be used instead of C/C++</li>
		<li>Go is very fast, so much so that compile times make it feel like a dynamic (scripting) language</li>
		<li>Go is somewhat rigid; although it can be expressive, it does much to prevent/discourage experimentation (e.g., using it to create domain-specific languages, or DSLs)</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
