    <title>Challenging Pure Perl Object - Multi-D</title>
    <description>

      <p>
        A Perl Object Oriented Program to model a multi-dimension matrix.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have developed Perl Object, Multi-D, control a 2-d matrix model to
        represent the same 3-d system.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is as simple as that.   I know all the math, I know the complete
        structure of the Object.  I know all the inputs and outputs to each
        object within the object right down to the base object and how it all
        interrelates to product the same output object.  I also know the
        complete structure of the output object and how all its tiny little
        objects represent all the tiny little objects in the input Object.  So
        in essence, I have a fairly good understanding of the object.  And I
        have it all laid out and named and what each object represents in 10
        files.  Text files all object oriented.  I need the Object Multi-D to
        first read these files to create itself.
