    <title>Career Communications - A Practical Approach</title>
    <description>

      <p>

        The ability to communicate well is critical to success in any job. You
        must be able to express yourself both confidently and effectively.
        Without that winning combination, it can be almost impossible to
        understand different cultures, navigate your career and distinguish
        yourself. It is one of the key steps in demonstrating your value to an
        organization and to members of your team.

        Michelle Warren will be presenting a dynamic, informative and
        interactive mini-workshop to help you position yourself. As a
        professional communications coach with over 10 years of leading
        workshops and seminars, she uses her IT industry experience to help IT
        individuals to set and achieve goals, communicate more effectively, and
        be more productive at work.  In addition, she is a pioneer in the use
        of social networking tools to help individuals with marketing,
        branding, and self-promotion.  She is excited to be working again with
        Perl Mongers to help with career development and hone their
        communication skills.
