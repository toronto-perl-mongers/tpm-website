    <title>Hacking on the MetaCPAN VM</title>
    <description>

      <p>

        In order to speed up hacking on MetaCPAN, virtual machines (VM) can now
        be downloaded to get you up and running in a hurry.  These VMs are
        preconfigured and Debian machines which come with pretty much
        everything you need to get MetaCPAN up and running on your own machine.
        To download your own VM before the meeting beggins, checkout the <a
        href="https://github.com/cpan-api/metacpan-developer">metacpan-developer</a>
        instructions.

      <p>

        In the first part of this talk (in the October meeting) we got the VM
        installed and ready to go.  Now, a month later, we'll be ready to
        contribute to MetaCPAN directly.  The hope is that we can squash a few
        bugs together and send at least a couple of pull requests to the
        MetaCPAN team.
