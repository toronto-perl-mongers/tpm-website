    <description>
      <p>Watch in mesmerized terror as Damian hacks code in several
        unrelated
        programming languages (none of them Perl). Along the way, you'll
        also discover what's wrong with modern CS education, why programmers
        shouldn't frequent casinos, the power of Thor's Law, the language
        of moisture vaporators, C++ mysticism, how to use the three shells,
        state machines on steroids, programming without variables or
        subroutines, a cheap and eco-friendly alternative for distributed
        persistent computation, what the Romans used instead of braces, the
        ancient probabilistic wisdom of bodkins, and the price of fish.</p>


      <p>(Ed.: This is going to be the more outlandish of his talks this
        year.  It is a new-and-improved version of a talk Damian last gave
        in Toronto seven years ago where he demonstrates his virtuosity --
        and insanity -- in many programming languages and paradigms.  Computer
        geeks from all language backgrounds should enjoy this thoroughly.)</p>
