    <description>
      <p>In June 2000, Larry Wall announced a new four-month Open
        Source development
        effort: the reinvention of Perl. In this keynote, Damian Conway
        will unfold the twisting and sordid tale of what happened over the
        next ten years of the project, highlighting the sexy new language
        that has been created, the extreme violence that was sometimes
        necessary to make it happen, and the dozen or so harsh-but-invaluable
        lessons that the development team learned along the way.</p>
