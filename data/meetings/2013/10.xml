    <title>Installing the MetaCPAN VM</title>
    <description>

      In order to speed up hacking on MetaCPAN, virtual machines (VM) can now
      be downloaded to get you up and running in a hurry.  These VMs are
      preconfigured and Debian machines which come with pretty much everything
      you need to get MetaCPAN up and running on your own machine.  To download
      your own VM before the meeting beggins, checkout the <a
      href="https://github.com/cpan-api/metacpan-developer">metacpan-developer</a>
      instructions.

      In this first of two parts, we'll talk about what it takes to get the VM
      up and running and we'll take some time to troubleshoot any issues which
      folks have had with the basic install.  Please do follow the instructions
      listed above to install (or at least download) the VM before the meeting
      begins, so that we can be as productive as possible.

      MetaCPAN makes use of Vagrant, VirtualBox, ElasticSearch, Catalyst,
      jQuery, Template Toolkit and a whole lot of other technology which can
      help you towards full buzzword compliance.
