        VENUE CHANGE: We're trying out a new venue as it looks like our
        old venue will be lost to us later this year.
        OANDA's offices are at 370 King Street West, Toronto, ON. Go to the
        west elevators and head on up to the second floor. The door is locked,
        please knock and someone will let you in.

      <p>
        Matt Phillips, Justin Pacheco, Stuart Watt, and Dave Doyle will be
        presenting this evening.

    <title>AngularJS Directives</title>
    <description>
      <p>
        A look at some of the directives in AngularJS, and at how to write
        your own directives - that's where the fun starts and what makes
        AngularJS such a great framework compared to the "classical" template
        based ones to Stuart.

    <description>
      <p>
        After a two year absence, what is it like returning to Perl? What are
        the accepted standards in Perl now as represented by the Modern Perl
        movement?
