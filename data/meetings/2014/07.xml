      <p>
        Two talks this time around though any attendees of YAPC::NA
        last month are welcome to talk about interesting talks they
        saw and do a recap for us.  I particularly regret missing
        Charles Stross's keynote as I'm a big fan.

    <title>Getting the most out of Regular Expressions</title>
    <description>
      <p>
        Perl's regular expression engine is one of the most advanced
        around. This talk will discuss some well-known and
        less-well-known modules that can help you take full advantage
        of regexps. Regexp::Debugger - debug and performance profile
        your regular expressions. Regexp::Assemble - compose multiple
        regexps into a single monster regexp. Regexp::Grammars -
        remember how parsing nested structures with regexps is
        "impossible"? Not any-more. Regexp::Exhaustive - no match
        left behind. Bio::Regexp - apply perl regular expressions
        to bio-informatics problems. Bonus: We'll also talk about
        some neat unicode regexp features, perl 5.14's re-entrant
        regexp engine, and a long-standing regexp segfault bug
        finally fixed in perl 5.18.
