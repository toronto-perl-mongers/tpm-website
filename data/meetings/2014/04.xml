    <title>SyContent</title>
    <description>
      <p>
        SyContent is a publishing service written in Perl, using
        Google V8 scripting engine. It allows content management in
        the cloud, while still using own resources to host the content
        and to assure the privacy of website users. The author,
        Getty, will introduce many advantages of the concept in the
        talk, next to an explanation on how the system was built.
