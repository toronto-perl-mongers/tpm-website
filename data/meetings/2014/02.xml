    <title>DECK and an Introduction to Smalltalk</title>
    <description>
      <p>
      This frist talk describes Deck, a small experimental programming
      language.  I will describe the language and some of the reasoning
      behind its design, as well as the details of its implementation in
      Perl.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second talk will be a brief introduction to Smalltalk.
