    <synopsis>
      <p>
        Every September we do Lightning talks: 5 minute time boxed
        presentations on anything you think might be of interest
        to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please feel free to drop me a line to get yourself added.
        If your presentation is strictly slides, please email them
        to dave.s.doyle@gmail.com ahead of the meeting so I can set
        them up on my machine to simplify the presentation process
        and keep things easy for our Google Hangout broadcast.
