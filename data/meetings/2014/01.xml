    <title>Hacking on the MetaCPAN VM</title>
    <description>
      In order to speed up hacking on <a
      href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a>, virtual machines
      (VM) can now be downloaded to get you up and running in a
      hurry. These VMs are preconfigured and Debian machines which
      come with pretty much everything you need to get MetaCPAN up
      and running on your own machine. To download your own VM
      before the meeting begins, checkout the instructions.

      In the first part of this talk (in the October meeting) we
      got the VM installed and ready to go. Now, we'll be ready to
      contribute to MetaCPAN directly. The hope is that we can
      squash a few bugs together and send at least a couple of pull
      requests to the MetaCPAN team.

      To download your own VM before the meeting begins, <a

      the instructions</a>.
